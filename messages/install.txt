# Thanks for installing Write.app for Sublime Text!
===================================================

*Before you get started, be sure to edit your settings or the plugin will not work*

## Setup
===================================================

1. Go to 'Preferences > Settings - User'

2. In your settings file add the following lines to the list of settings already present:

	"writeapper_user": "yourUsername",
	"writeapp_pass": "yourPassword"

Just replace the relevant parts with your username and your password and you're ready to go!

## Usage
===================================================

To save your file to your Write.app account press 'alt+s' or right click anywhere inside the
text you are editing and choose "Save to Write.app".

To tell Write.app to add a title to your note or make your note public add the proper
YAML front matter at the first line of your file. The following is an example of how this works:

---
title: My Great Note
public: true
---
Note content goes here



Please see http://github.com/WrtApp/Writeapp for more details on setup and usage.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This version of the plugin can only save notes to Write.app that have already been saved
on your computer. Future releases will have the ability to send notes to Write.app from
saved or unsaved files.
